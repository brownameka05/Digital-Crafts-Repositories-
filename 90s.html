The 1990s were a simpler time, when frosted
hair tips were all the rage and boy bands
ruled the music charts. It was a time when kids
constantly quoted Nickelodeon cartoons and adults
copied Rachel Green’s hairstyle and Carrie

iconic musicians,movies, TV shows, games, toys, snacks,
and fashion trends.To fuel your 90s nostalgia, here are
some of the most popular fads that defined the decade.
